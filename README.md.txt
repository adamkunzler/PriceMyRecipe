# PriceMyRecipe
AngularJS application used for pricing out a recipe per ingredient, based on an ingredient's mass and volume.

## About PriceMyRecipe

The idea for this project spawned from the need of a friend to price out her recipes for preparing different baked goods for orders recieved from various clients, cafes, et cetera.

**Current Features**
- Use existing or create custom ingredients
- Select which Store an ingredient was purchased from, including how much (quantity) and how much (price)
- Ability to create new recipes, adding ingredients to build the recipe out
- Calculations based on mass and volume or pieces

## Tech Used
The application is built using AngularJS and various other JS libraries\frameworks. It's a sort-of first attempt at using AngularJS. The UI is simple and built using Bootstrap.

The backend is a MySQL database. Server-side code is written in PHP. I'm brand new to PHP and did the best I could with it. AngularJS promises make requests to the PHP server code and return data to the application.
